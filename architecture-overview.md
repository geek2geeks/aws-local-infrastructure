# Local Cloud Infrastructure: System Architecture Overview

## System Philosophy

Our system creates a local cloud infrastructure that mirrors AWS service patterns while maintaining complete control over implementation and deployment. We achieve this by implementing AWS-like APIs and conventions within a Docker-based environment, enabling applications to interact with our services as they would with AWS services, while keeping all processing and data under our control.

## Core Architecture Components

### Service Layer

The Service Layer operates as our system's foundation, implementing core functionalities through distinct, containerized services. Each service maintains its own API that mirrors its AWS counterpart, ensuring familiarity and consistency.

Primary Services:
1. Compute Service (EC2-Style)
   - Manages LLM inference workloads
   - Handles resource allocation for compute-intensive tasks
   - Provides scaling and resource management within container limits

2. Storage Service (DynamoDB-Style)
   - Manages JSON document storage
   - Implements query patterns similar to DynamoDB
   - Handles data persistence and retrieval

3. API Gateway Service
   - Routes requests to appropriate services
   - Handles authentication and request validation
   - Manages API versioning and documentation

4. Monitoring Service (CloudWatch-Style)
   - Collects metrics from all services
   - Tracks resource utilization and costs
   - Provides monitoring dashboard and alerts

### Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure Layer manages the physical resources and container orchestration:

1. Resource Management
   - GPU allocation for the RTX 3090

   - External API access
   - Security and access control

3. Storage Management
   - Volume management for persistent data

The Integration Layer ensures smooth communication between components:

1. Service Discovery
   - Simple service registration and discovery

Service Layer Decisions:
One of our most important architectural decisions was implementing distinct containerized services that mirror AWS patterns. The reasoning here is multifaceted. By creating separate services for compute, storage, and API management, we gain several advantages:
First, this separation allows us to manage resources more effectively. Your RTX 3090 has 24GB of VRAM, which is a precious resource that needs careful management. By containerizing services, we can set specific resource limits and ensure that the LLM service, which will be the most resource-intensive, gets the GPU resources it needs without interfering with other services.
Second, this architecture makes future cloud migration much simpler. When you eventually move to a cloud VM, each service can be migrated independently, and the interfaces between services won't need to change. This is particularly important since you mentioned you'll be deploying this entire infrastructure to your own cloud server rather than transitioning to managed AWS services.
Infrastructure Layer Design:
The decision to implement a separate infrastructure layer for resource management stems from your specific hardware setup. With a 5950x CPU, 64GB of RAM, and an RTX 3090, you have a powerful but finite set of resources. The infrastructure layer acts as a traffic controller, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently.
We chose to implement simplified resource management rather than a complex AWS-style scheduling system because you're operating on a single machine rather than a distributed system. This gives us the benefits of resource control without the overhead of managing a distributed resource scheduler.
Integration Layer Choices:
In the integration layer, we made a deliberate choice to implement simplified versions of AWS-style services. For example, our service discovery system is simpler than AWS Service Discovery because we're operating in a single Docker Compose environment. This gives us the benefits of service discovery (like easy service location and health checking) without the complexity of managing a distributed service mesh.
The decision to use CloudWatch-compatible metrics, however, was strategic. Even though we're implementing a simpler system overall, having metrics in a CloudWatch-compatible format means your monitoring tools and dashboards will work the same way locally and in the cloud. This consistency is valuable for operations and troubleshooting.
API and Authentication Design:
The choice to mirror AWS API patterns while implementing simpler authentication was based on your requirements. By keeping the API patterns similar to AWS, we ensure that applications written to work with your local infrastructure will have a familiar interface. However, since you indicated that simpler authentication would suffice, we avoided the complexity of implementing a full AWS IAM-style system. This gives us security without unnecessary complexity.
Storage Architecture:
The decision to implement DynamoDB-style interfaces for JSON storage is particularly important. This choice means that applications can use familiar query patterns and data models, but we maintain complete control over the underlying storage implementation. This is especially valuable since you mentioned you'll be working primarily with JSON data.
Container Orchestration:
Choosing Docker Compose over more complex orchestration systems like Kubernetes was based on your specific use case. Since you're running on a single machine and will be moving the entire infrastructure to a cloud VM, Docker Compose provides sufficient orchestration capabilities without the operational overhead of a full container orchestration platform.
Monitoring and Metrics:
The decision to implement comprehensive monitoring from the start, rather than adding it later, was strategic. By building monitoring into the core architecture, we ensure that you'll have visibility into system performance and resource usage from day one. This is crucial for understanding how your applications are using resources and for planning your cloud migration.
