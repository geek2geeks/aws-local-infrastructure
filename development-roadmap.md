# Development Roadmap: Local AWS Infrastructure

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Infrastructure Core
Our initial focus builds the essential framework that everything else will rely on. We start here because a solid foundation prevents major architectural changes later.

Development Priorities:
1. Basic Docker infrastructure setup
   - Network configuration
   - Resource management systems
   - Basic monitoring setup

2. Core service framework
   - API Gateway implementation
   - Basic authentication system
   - Service discovery mechanism

Success Criteria:
- Docker containers successfully communicating
- Resource monitoring operational
- Basic API routing functional

## Phase 2: Core Services (Weeks 3-4)

### Primary Service Implementation
We focus on implementing the most critical services first, ensuring they work reliably before adding more complex features.

Development Priorities:
1. Bedrock Service (LLM)
   - Basic inference endpoints
   - Model management
   - Resource optimization for RTX 3090

2. DynamoDB Service
   - Basic CRUD operations
   - JSON document handling
   - Query functionality

Success Criteria:
- LLM service running efficiently
- Database operations working reliably
- Services properly integrated with monitoring

## Phase 3: Monitoring & Management (Weeks 5-6)

### Operational Excellence
Adding comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities ensures we can operate the system effectively.

Development Priorities:
1. CloudWatch Implementation
   - Metric collection
   - Log aggregation
   - Alert system

2. Management Dashboard
   - Resource visualization
   - Performance metrics
   - Cost analysis

Success Criteria:
- Real-time monitoring functional
- Alert system operational
- Dashboard providing useful insights

## Phase 4: Security & Optimization (Weeks 7-8)

### Hardening & Performance
Focusing on security and performance optimization prepares the system for production use.

Development Priorities:
1. Security Implementation
   - Enhanced authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - Access control refinement

2. Performance Optimization
   - Request batching
   - Cache implementation
   - Resource usage optimization

Success Criteria:
- Security measures validated
- Performance metrics meeting targets
- System running efficiently

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (Weeks 9-10)

### Quality Assurance
Comprehensive testing and documentation ensures reliability and usability.

Development Priorities:
1. Testing Implementation
   - Unit test suite
   - Integration tests
   - Load testing

2. Documentation Completion
   - API documentation
   - Operation guides
   - Troubleshooting guides

Success Criteria:
- Test coverage adequate
- Documentation complete
- System ready for production use

## Ongoing Development

### Continuous Improvement
After initial implementation, ongoing development focuses on enhancements and additions.

Focus Areas:
1. New Service Addition
   - Additional AWS-style services
   - Enhanced capabilities
   - New integrations

2. System Enhancement
   - Performance improvements
   - Feature additions
   - Security updates

Success Criteria:
