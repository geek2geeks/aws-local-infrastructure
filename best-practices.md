# Best Practices for Junior Developers Working with LLM Project Management

## Development Practices

### Version Control Management

Your code is like a story, and each commit is a chapter. Making regular, meaningful commits helps track your progress and maintain code quality. Here's how to approach it:

Start each coding session by pulling the latest changes:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

Create a new branch for each feature or task:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
```

Commit your changes frequently, using meaningful commit messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(service-name): brief description of changes

- Detailed explanation of what changed
- Why the change was necessary
- Any important technical details"
```

Push your changes regularly to maintain a backup and show progress:
```bash
git push origin feature/descriptive-name
```

### Code Organization

Think of your code like a well-organized library. Each file and folder should have a clear purpose:

1. Keep files focused and single-purpose
2. Use clear, descriptive names for files and functions
3. Group related functionality together
4. Follow the established AWS-style naming conventions

### Documentation

Documentation is like leaving notes for your future self. Make it a habit to:

1. Write docstrings for all functions and classes
2. Update README files when adding new features
3. Document any non-obvious technical decisions
4. Keep API documentation current

## Working with LLM Project Management

### Communication Best Practices

When interacting with the LLM project manager, think of it as a conversation with a knowledgeable mentor. Here's how to get the best results:

1. Context Setting
   Provide clear context in your questions:
   ```
   "I'm working on the Bedrock service implementation. 
   I've completed the basic API setup and now I'm working on
   GPU resource management. Here's what I've done so far..."
   ```

2. Specific Questions
   Ask focused, specific questions:
   ```
   Instead of: "How should I implement this?"
   Better: "What's the best way to implement GPU memory management 
   for the Bedrock service considering our RTX 3090 hardware?"
   ```

3. Progress Updates
   Provide regular status updates:
   ```
   "I've implemented the basic monitoring service following your 
   guidance. Here are the current metrics being collected: [list]. 
   Should I add any additional metrics?"
   ```

### Feedback Loop Strategy

Establish a regular feedback pattern with the LLM:

1. Morning Planning
   Start each day with a brief plan:
   ```
   "Here's what I plan to work on today:
   1. Complete GPU monitoring implementation
   2. Start work on metric collection
   3. Update documentation
   
   Does this align with our priorities?"
   ```

2. Implementation Checks
   During development, validate your approach:
   ```
   "Here's my proposed implementation for [feature]:
   [code snippet or pseudo-code]
   
   Does this align with our architecture and best practices?"
   ```

3. End-of-Day Review
   Summarize your progress:
   ```
   "Today I completed:
   - Implemented GPU monitoring
   - Started metric collection
   - Found challenges with [issue]
   
   What should I prioritize for tomorrow?"
   ```

### Problem-Solving Approach

When facing challenges, follow this structured approach:

1. Problem Definition
   ```
   "I'm encountering [specific issue] when implementing [feature].
   Here's the relevant code and error messages..."
   ```

2. Attempted Solutions
   ```
   "I've tried:
   1. [approach 1] - Result: [outcome]
   2. [approach 2] - Result: [outcome]
   
   What other approaches should I consider?"
   ```

3. Learning Documentation
   Document solutions for future reference:
   ```
   "Based on your guidance, I solved [issue] by [solution].
   I'll document this in our troubleshooting guide."
   ```

## Quality Assurance Practices

### Testing

Make testing a natural part of your development process:

1. Write tests alongside your code
2. Test edge cases and error conditions
3. Run the full test suite before commits
4. Document test scenarios and coverage

### Code Review Preparation

Prepare your code for review by the LLM:

1. Self-Review Checklist
   - Code follows style guidelines
   - Documentation is complete
   - Tests are implemented
   - Error handling is in place

2. Review Request Format
   ```
   "I've completed [feature]. Here's what to review:
   - Main changes: [files/functions]
   - Key decisions: [list]
   - Areas of concern: [specific points]
   
   Please evaluate for:
   1. Architecture alignment
   2. Best practices
   3. Performance considerations"
   ```

## Learning and Growth

### Knowledge Building

Actively build your understanding:

1. Keep a development journal
2. Document new concepts you learn
3. Create examples of patterns you use
4. Build a personal reference library

### Skill Development

Focus on systematic improvement:

1. Master one concept before moving to the next
2. Practice new patterns in isolation
3. Review and refactor old code
4. Study AWS documentation for service patterns

## Communication Templates

### Daily Update Template
```
Morning Plan:
- Today's objectives: [list]
- Questions/blockers: [list]
- Resources needed: [list]

Evening Update:
- Completed tasks: [list]
- Challenges encountered: [list]
- Tomorrow's priorities: [list]
```

### Problem Report Template
```
Issue Description:
- What: [specific problem]
- Where: [location in code]
- When: [timing/frequency]
- Impact: [effects on system]

Current Status:
- Attempted solutions: [list]
- Current blockers: [list]
- Requested guidance: [specific questions]
```

By following these best practices and communication patterns, you'll establish an effective working relationship with the LLM project manager while maintaining high development standards. Remember to adapt these practices as you gain experience and as the project evolves.
